# ICRAR_Project_UNUM
My ICRAR project on IEEE failures and the rise of UNUMs as a new number system for computation.

Contains:
  i) Triangle_Rounding - showing how huge differences in our final result can arise from ULP sized differences in lengths
  ii) Logistic - a follow on from (i) showing a similar effect when utilising a chaotic system (The Logistic Map)
  iii) Image_Processing - using differences from IEEE rounding to generate images and apply them to astronomical images as noise (Thanks to Andreas Wicenec for most of the source code)
  iv) Parallax - showing how small differences resulting from precision can have profound effects on the accuracy of our final result
  v) Report - my final report on UNUMs and IEEE
